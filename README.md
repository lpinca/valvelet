This is a small utility to limit the execution rate of a function. It is useful
for scenarios such as REST APIs consumption where the amount of requests per
unit of time should not exceed a given threshold.

This module is very similar to [`node-function-rate-limit`][function-rate-limit].
The difference is that `valvelet` works seamlessly with promise-returning
functions.

## Install

```
npm install --save valvelet
```

## API

The module exports a single function that takes three arguments.

### valvelet(fn, limit, interval[, size])

Returns a function which should be called instead of `fn`. The function returned
by `valvelet` returns a promise which resolves to the value returned by `fn`.

**Arguments**

- `fn` - The function to rate limit calls to.
- `limit` - The maximum number of allowed calls per `interval`.
- `interval` - The timespan where `limit` is calculated.
- `size` - The maximum size of the internal queue. Defaults to 2^32 - 1 which is
  the maximum array size in JavaScript.

When the internal queue is at capacity, the function returned by valvelet
returns a promise that is rejected.

**Example**

```js
const valvelet = require('valvelet');

const get = valvelet(function request(i) {
  return Promise.resolve(`${i} - ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
}, 2, 1000);

function log(data) {
  console.log(data);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  get(i).then(log);
}

```

## Disclaimers

This module is not a complete solution if you are trying to throttle 
your requests to a remote API, but have multiple Node.js processes or
on the same or multiple hosts, since the state is not shared between
the services. That case can be addressed by allowing each process
to send up to only a fraction of the total limit. 
Ex: If you have 4 processes, let each process send up to $limit/4.
